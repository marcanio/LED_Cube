# LED_Cube
Hardware project-"Dancing LED cube"

This project was built using 256 LED's. They were soldered together using the following pattern - Negative leads were vertical for all LEDs,
And positive leads were all horizontal. This was done in order to supply power to indivual LED's or an entire level. Since each poitive lead
was horizontal I supplied power to each level using 6 wires (Blue wires in the back of the cube). And each negative lead was attached to ground
(All the red cables on the bottom). With this set up I was able to select exact rows and columns I wanted to light up.
The code provided makes the cube dance to music using an ardunio microphone. Based on the level of noise in the surrondings it would light
up different levels.
